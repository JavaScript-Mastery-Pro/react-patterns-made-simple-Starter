## ðŸ’» Exercise: Refactor into Composable Card Components

You're given a single ProductCard component that's doing everything at once from layout to logic.

Your goal: Refactor this into smaller, reusable composable components using the Composition Pattern.

### ðŸ§  What to Build

Refactor the component into:
- Card (outer wrapper)
- CardHeader (image section)
- CardBadge (label for new products)
- CardBody (title and description)
- CardPrice (price display)
- CardFooter (action buttons)

Make these flexible so you can create different types of cards by mixing and matching the building blocks.
